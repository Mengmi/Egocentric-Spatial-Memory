# Egocentric-Spatial-Memory
We introduce an integrated deep neural network architecture for modeling Egocentric Spatial Memory (ESM). It learns to estimate the occupancy state of the world and progressively construct top-down 2D global maps from egocentric views in a spatially extended environment. Source codes for simulation environments and network training will be released soon.
